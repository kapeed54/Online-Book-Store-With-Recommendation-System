Bootstrap 4 for Django.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to seamlessly blend Django and Bootstrap 4.

## Roadmap

Bootstrap 4 has been superseded by Bootstrap 5. As a result, this package is now in maintenance mode and will only receive bug fixes and security updates. No new features or enhancements will be added. We recommend that new projects use Bootstrap 5 and encourage existing projects to consider migrating when feasible.

For Bootstrap 5, please refer to our dedicated package: [django-bootstrap5](https://github.com/zostera/django-bootstrap5).

## Requirements

This package requires a combination of Python and Django that is currently supported.

See "Supported Versions" on https://www.djangoproject.com/download/.

## Documentation

The full documentation is at https://django-bootstrap4.readthedocs.io/

1. Install using pip:

```bash
pip install django-bootstrap4
```

   Alternatively, you can install download or clone this repo and call ``pip install -e .``.

2. Add to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
  # ...
  "bootstrap4",
  # ...
)
```

3. In your templates, load the `bootstrap4` library and use the `bootstrap_*` tags. See example below.

    {% buttons %}

    {% endbuttons %}

```
